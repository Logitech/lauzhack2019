- Can AI help __find the eSports athletes__ with the highest potential?
- Can AI help __eSports athletes__ optimize their performance (cognitive, physical and - communication)?
- Can AI __drive immersion__ in remote collaboration scenarios?
- Can Jaybird help __coach athletes__ and optimize their training efficacy, e.g. get - the most of every run?
- Can connected __lights enhance__ the quality of a stream or cast?
- Can recorded __video be parsed__, labelled, cleaned and edited automatically?
- Can AI automatically __grade the quality__ and audience impact of a video clip?

# Resources

* [Craft SDK](https://github.com/Logitech/logi_craft_sdk/)

Create a custom plugin/profile that maps your app/software functions to our unique rotary controller called Crown. The plugin will give you the ability to map your app functions depending on the context of your user. For instance, when a user selects text, the font size is adjusted via the Crown.
